# CADE:
### This repository contains the guide and the documentation that describe how to use the model and how to run the experiments. Data used is present in the repository through links.

	* code + data: (https://github.com/valedica/twec/)
# TEE:
### These repository contain the main implementation of the model. The first link is a reference to the paper published at ISWC2018, while the second link contains the instruction on how to generate the models.
	* code + data: (https://github.com/vinid/time-aware) (main results, also contains data)
	* code + data: (https://github.com/vinid/knowledgespaces) (general model)

# Reasoning: 
### These repository contain the experiments and the guide on how to replicate the results. There are ipython notebooks to play with the data. All the data is already in the repository. The first link contain some simple experiments while the second one is the actual implementaion of the combination between embeddings and the logic tensor networks.
	* code + data: (https://github.com/vinid/ltns_experiments) (first experimental paper)
	* code + data: (https://github.com/vinid/logical_commonsense)(acutal paper that combines the embeddings)
